# Exercise 2: Merge and rebase

In this exercise we will work with `git merge` and `git rebase` to combine
work from different branches.

For this, we will use three different branches: `ex2-main`, `ex2-feature`, and
`ex2-sub-feature`. The task is to combine `ex2-feature` and `ex2-sub-feature`
using `git rebase` and then merge the result into `ex2-main`. Once that is
done, make sure `ex2-main` is up to date using `git pull`.


## Useful commands

* `git merge --no-ff <branch>`
* `git rebase <branch>`
* `git pull`
* `git fetch` (Always useful)
