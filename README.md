# Exercise 1: Good commits

In this exercise we will work on creating sensible commits from changes to
multiple files.

There are three text files in this repo: `main.md`, `second.md`, and
`third.md`. The task is to make several changes to each of these files, and
then breaking these changes down into separate commits.

Also, make sure you try to edit the last commit by adding an additional change
and also changing the commit message.

## Useful commands:

* `git add --patch`
* `git commit --amend`
* `git status`
* `git diff`/`git diff --staged`
