# Exercise 3: Handling conflicts

In this exercise we will work on resolving merge conflicts.

Working in pairs, each of you will create a new branch based off of
`ex3-handling-conflicts`.

Add one or more lines to `questions.txt` and `answers.txt`, commit, and push.

Then, once both of you have pushed your branches, try to merge your partners
branch into your own. Resolve any conflicts.

## Useful commands:

* `git fetch`
* `git merge origin/<branch>`
* `git merge --continue`/`git merge --abort`
